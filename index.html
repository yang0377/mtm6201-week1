                <p>As a creative photographer, I thrive on experimenting with diverse styles. My passion lies in capturing moments through Documentary Photography, Street Photography, B & W, Landscape, and Portrait genres. What sets me apart is my dedication to preserving the natural essence of my subjects. Moreover, I actively promote the notion of challenging the conventional male gaze in photographing women, seeking to explore their unique features through my lens. Currently pursuing my studies in Interactive Media Design at ABC College, I am deeply passionate about the field and constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge. Continuous growth and self-improvement are integral parts of my character, driving me to push boundaries and strive for excellence in my work.</p>
